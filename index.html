                    <p>Hello!  My name is Mike Nezzer, I am currently an accountant for small non-profit quasi-governmental agency.  I have a number of different duties including payroll, time and attendance management, as well as retirement administration and banking services.  I have my American Payroll Association professional certification as well as being a licensed property and casualty insurance adjuster in Texas.   I’ve dabbled in website design and made some websites for friends and family.  I’m ready for a career change and the  UT Coding boot-camp is hopefully the perfect vehicle to assist me in a launching into a  new career path!</p>
                    <p>My job as accountant deals with documenting and reporting the details of financial transactions that have already happened. Being creative and making something new are the exciting parts of the coding experience that I look forward to the most.  I feel like my background in logical thinking with accounting and spreadsheets will translate to the analytical side of coding.    I am eager to using my creative side in my professional life.</p>
                    <p>My current creative outlet is playing guitar and bass.  I have played in several local bands and continue to play guitar and write songs on a regular basis with different people in town.  The ability to develop camaraderie, to give and receive criticism, and assemble all the different parts of music into a song is a valuable lesson on being part of a team.  It doesn’t how matter long you play an instrument there is always more to learn and master.  I look at my journey into this boot-camp and coding in a similar fashion.  There is so much to learn and master, and I’m excited to learn from our instructor and teaching assistants but also my class mates as well. I have a feeling that in coding, as is in playing music, if you are open to it, you can learn something new from someone, no matter how long you’ve been doing it.</p>
                    <p>I’m married and live in Austin Texas.   I have two daughters who are in college and we have two corgis.  We are avid sports fans and Texas Longhorn fans.   I love many different genres of music and playing different types of music with as many people as I can.  I feel humbled and grateful for this opportunity to embark on a new adventure at this point in my life, and I’m just so exhilarated to be a part of this class.   </p>
